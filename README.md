## How to run

### Dataset

We provide a set of training data derived from the United States data in the Google COVID-19 Open Data repository. The models trained on data from other countries, along with their corresponding output files, are stored in dedicated folders. In addition, we have uploaded the numerical simulation code used in our study.

### Execution Workflow

The training process is located in the `NeuralNetwork` folder. After running the training script, the resulting models will be saved in the `Model` folder. The symbolic regression code can be found in the `SymbolicRegression` directory. Finally, all plotting scripts used for result visualization are contained in the `plt` folder.
